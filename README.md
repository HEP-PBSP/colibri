## Documentation

Documentation regarding the usage and installation is available at <https://hep-pbsp.github.io/colibri/>

## Features
- Perform PDF fits using flexible parametrisations
- Support for JAX-based computations (CPU by default)
- Optional GPU (CUDA) support for accelerated JAX operations
- Command-line scripts for common workflows (`colibri`, `evolve_fit`, etc.)
- Integration with external PDF model repositories

---

## Installation

This section covers installing `colibri` in various ways. By default, `pip install hep-colibri` installs JAX CPU build and all core dependencies. For GPU support, see the separate section below.

### 1. Development Installation via Conda

You can install colibri easily by first cloning the repository and the using the provided `environment.yml` file

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HEP-PBSP/colibri
cd colibri
```

from your conda base environment run 

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml

```

This will create a `colibri-dev` environment installed in development mode.
If you want to use a different environment name you can run:

```bash
conda env create -n myenv -f environment.yml
```


### 2. Installing with pip

If you don't want to clone the repository and don't need to work in development mode you can follow the installation instructions below.

> **Note:** 
> Most of the `colibri` dependencies are available in the [PyPi repository](https://pypi.org/), however non-python codes such as LHAPDF and pandoc wonâ€™t be installed automatically and neeed to be manually installed in the environment because of this we recommend to use a conda environment.

Create a conda environment from your base environment, for instance

```bash
conda create -n colibri-dev python>=3.11
```

In this new environment install the following conda packages

```bash
conda install mpich lhapdf pandoc mpi4py ultranest pip
```

After having completed this you can simply install the rest of the dependencies with `pip`:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install hep-colibri
```

to verify that the installation went trough

```bash
python -c "import colibri; print(colibri.__version__)"
colibri --help
```


### 3. GPU (CUDA) JAX Support

The installation instructions shown above will install jax in cpu mode. It is however possible to run
colibri fits using gpu cuda support too.
To do so, after installing the package following one of the methods shown above, if you are on a linux
machine you can install jax in cuda mode by running

```bash
pip install -U "jax[cuda12]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_releases.html

```
