=======

The important features of the
theory covariance module fall into three broad categories:

#. **Matrices and plots of matrices**. Heatmap plots, diagonal element
   plots comparing experimental and theoretical errors.

#. :math:`\chi^2` **values**. Total :math:`\chi^2`\ s and per dataset
   and per experiment. Bar chart comparing before and after adding
   theory errors for the per dataset case.

#. **Scale variations as a function of kinematics.** Plots of the
   theoretical predictions for each data point for the different scale
   choices.

For an example set of reports and explanations of their contents see
:ref:`here <theory-covmat-examples>`.
