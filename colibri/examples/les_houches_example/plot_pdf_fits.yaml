pdfs:       # these are the pdf sets that will be used for the fitting
# For the model-specific closure test, you need the following two PDF sets (comment out otherwise):
  # - {id: "lh_fit_model_specific_closure_test", label: "Les Houches fit"}   # generated by the colibri fit
  # - {id: "lh_theory", label: "LH theory"} # this is the result of computing the PDFs in the LH parametrisation,
                                          # using the best fit values of the parameters. 
# For a closure test, you need the following two PDF sets:
  - {id: "lh_fit_closure_test", label: "Les Houches fit"} # generated by the colibri fit
  - {id: "LH_PARAM_20250512", label: "LH theory PDF"} # downloaded PDF to compare with the fit.

# This pdf set will be displayed with no error band. 
# It could equivalently be called by its index number as per the pdf list above, eg. [2].  

# pdfs_noband: ["lh_theory"]           # If doing a model-specific closure test.
pdfs_noband: ["LH_PARAM_20250512"] # If doing a standard closure test.
